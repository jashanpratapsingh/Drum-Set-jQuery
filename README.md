# Drum Set jQuery

This is a static website that is built using jQuery, JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3. It is pretty simple to use and makes sounds when the specific keys are pressed and along with this it works with tapping on the specific drum intruments as well. One can create his own rythms and tunes by this website.
